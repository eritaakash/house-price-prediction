## House Price Prediction 

This project involves a Linear Regression Model developed to predict house prices based on various features of a property. It contains a Linear Regression Model trained on [Kaggle's "House Price India" Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sukhmandeepsinghbrar/house-prices-india/data)


### Overview 

The goal of this project is to accurately predict the prices of houses using features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area, lot area, and more. The model provides insights that can help real estate agents, buyers, and sellers make informed decisions.


#### Key Features:
- Number of Bedrooms
- Number of Bathrooms
- Living Area
- Lot Area
- House Condition
- House Grade
- Age of the House
- Proximity to Amenities (e.g., schools, airport)


### Model Performance 

The model achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of **0.488** on the test dataset, indicating its strong performance in predicting house prices.

Here is the report of different metrics:
